## ‚ìò About the project

**The VideoGameBox** is a desktop application designed to manage and organize video game collections in a simple and efficient way. This project was developed as part of the course **Software Project Management and Development Methodologies (GPS)** at the **Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)**, using the agile methodology **Scrum**. The main idea is to provide users with large video game collections a tool that allows them to easily organize and visualize their games.

## üìå Information   
The application **The VideoGameBox** aims to provide an efficient way to manage video games by using the **IGDB API (Internet Game Database)** to obtain detailed information for each game. We use **Python** for data extraction and **MongoDB** to store all video game information in **JSON** format. Thanks to this, the system is capable of handling large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.

## üíª Key Technologies
  - **Java** and **Python** for the development of the desktop application and data extraction.
  - **MongoDB** as a NoSQL database for video game storage.
  - **[IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#examples)** to automatically obtain information about each video game.

## üìù Methodology 
The project was developed using **Scrum**, an agile methodology that allowed us to work iteratively and flexibly. In each **Sprint**, the team focused on achieving the most prioritized functionalities, using tools such as **[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)** to manage tasks and **Kanban** to visualize progress.

## üé≠ Key Roles
  - **Scrum Master:** Jos√© D√≠az Reviejo  
  - **Product Owner:** Juli√°n Moffatt  
  - **Development Team:** Including developers such as Mario Campos Sobrino, Carlos Carnero M√©rida, among others.

The agile methodology allowed us to quickly adapt to changes and continuously deliver functional increments of the product.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works?
**The VideoGameBox** enables users to manage their video game collection with ease. Through a user-friendly interface, they can search for, add, and organize games in their personal library. The application extracts information directly from the **IGDB API** and stores all data in a local database, making management more efficient.

## üé¨ Video Demo 
To better understand its functionality, we have provided a **video demo** where you can see the key features of the application, from game search to the organization and visualization of the collection.

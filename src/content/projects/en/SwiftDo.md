# SwiftDo

## About the Project

This is the repository for the final degree project: **Implementation of a privacy-conscious REST infrastructure for GTD**.

The productivity methodology "Getting Things Done" (GTD), created by David Allen, is one of the most effective methods for personal task organization. Its goal is to maximize productivity by consolidating all tasks, projects, and activities in one place.

## Project Components

This project is composed of two main parts:

### Backend (REST API)

The backend infrastructure consists of a REST API. Some aspects of this infrastructure include the use of the OAuth authorization standard to provide security to the API.

### Frontend

On the frontend, we are developing some clients to consume the API. The main feature of these clients is that they are built with the cross-platform framework React Native, which allows the same code to run on different platforms, such as mobile or desktop devices, across multiple environments like iOS, Android, and Windows, among others. Another feature of these clients is that they support offline mode.

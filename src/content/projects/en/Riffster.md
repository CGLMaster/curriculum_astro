## 💡 Motivation

This project emerged from curiosity to explore new APIs and, especially, from the opportunity to experiment with the API of an application I use daily. Spotify offers incredible freedom for developers through its API, which motivated me to create something of my own while learning. I chose Astro for its innovative approach to modern web development, although I faced interesting challenges, especially in handling the player state between navigations due to the dynamic nature of the application.

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

### Spotify API Configuration

   - Fill out the form with:
     - Application name
     - Description
     - Redirect URL (example: `http://localhost:4321` for development)
4. Once created, access the app settings to obtain:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Configure allowed URLs in "Redirect URIs"
   - Indicate in User Management if you want to give another Spotify account access to the API

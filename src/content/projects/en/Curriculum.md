## About the Project
This project is a personal website developed at the end of my studies, with the goal of presenting my resume in a modern and attractive way. The site was designed during my final year, using fundamental technologies for creating websites, while also serving to enhance my skills and explore new tools.

## Technologies Used
The website is built with the most common languages in web development: **HTML**, **CSS** (using SASS), and **JavaScript**.

- **HTML**: Used to structure the website, following best practices in web semantics. This language was already part of my studies, so its implementation in this project helped solidify my knowledge.
- **SASS**: Although I had already worked with CSS, I discovered SASS in this project, which proved to be a great advantage. SASS allowed me to work more efficiently on the styling by taking advantage of features such as variables, nested rules, and mixins. Additionally, I became familiar with using the terminal, as it is necessary to compile SASS into CSS for the browser to read.
- **JavaScript**: Employed to add interactivity to the website, including animations and dynamic features. This made the site more engaging and provided a better user experience.

## Design and Objectives
The main objective of this project was to create a simple yet functional website that caters to user needs by using straightforward yet modern technologies. The website is designed to be **responsive**, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.

With a clean and professional design, the site presents relevant information about my profile, skills, and the projects I have completed during my training. Additionally, it includes a contact form to facilitate communication, along with links to the technologies I work with and my most notable projects.

In summary, although this project is built on simple technologies, its focus is on delivering a modern, efficient, and accessible user experience while showcasing the knowledge I have acquired throughout my studies.
